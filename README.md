# Edge–Fog–Cloudlet–Cloud Healthcare Record Management System

# 1\. Problem Statement

The exponential growth of healthcare data—generated by IoT-enabled patient monitoring systems, diagnostic imaging devices, and electronic health records—presents a major challenge in terms of scalable and efficient data processing and management. Centralized cloud systems, although powerful, suffer from network latency, bandwidth limitations, and single-point failure risks. This project aims to simulate a resilient and scalable hierarchical architecture comprising Edge, Fog, Cloudlet, and Cloud nodes. It ensures low-latency, distributed preprocessing and storage of healthcare records while supporting fault tolerance and data rerouting.  
<br/>This work is highly relevant in modern cloud computing and edge computing landscapes where real-time processing and reliable data flow are critical, especially in time-sensitive domains such as healthcare.

<br/>Our project builds upon these ideas by adding fault tolerance, hierarchical modeling, and practical metrics.

# 3\. Existing Results

\- Latency in centralized cloud storage exceeds 100–200ms in remote healthcare environments.  
\- Fog computing reduces this to 30–50ms, but scalability and failure recovery remain under-addressed.  
\- Prior simulations focused on single-tier latency without multiple edge-fog-cloud interactions.  
This project benchmarks latency across all tiers and simulates failover to quantify resilience.

# 4\. Your Implementation

The system is implemented using Python and Flask, simulating:  
\- 160 Edge Devices (20 per Fog × 8 Fogs)  
\- 8 Fog Nodes (4 per Cloudlet × 2 Cloudlets)  
\- 2 Cloudlets routed to a single Cloud server  
<br/>\*\*Stack:\*\*  
\- Flask APIs for communication  
\- MongoDB for storage  
\- Matplotlib for latency visualization  
\- Bash scripts for simulation control  
<br/>\*\*Services Used:\*\*  
\- Localhost-based simulation mimicking cloud service interactions  
\- Rerouting of Edge requests during Fog failures  
\- Asynchronous processing and latency tracking

# 5\. Your Results

\- Average Edge-to-Fog latency: 25–45ms  
\- Fog processing time: 40–70ms (including failover scenarios)  
\- Cloudlet storage latency: 15–30ms  
\- Cloud archival latency: ~50ms  
\- Rerouting recovery latency: 5–15ms  
<br/>Graphs are generated to visualize component-wise and total latency over multiple iterations.

# 6\. Comparison and Analysis

| Metric | Literature (Fog-Only) | Our Architecture |  
|-----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|  
| Avg Total Latency | 80–120 ms | 60–90 ms |  
| Failure Recovery Time | Not handled | 5–15 ms rerouting |  
| Hierarchical Tiers | 2 (Fog-Cloud) | 4 (Edge-Fog-Cloudlet-Cloud) |  
| Scalable Architecture | Limited | Simulated 160 devices |  
<br/>Our results show improvements in resilience, scalability, and granularity of control.

# 7\. Conclusion

This project demonstrates that a multi-layered approach to healthcare data processing—from Edge to Fog to Cloudlet and finally to Cloud—is both scalable and fault-tolerant. The use of multiple fog nodes and rerouting mechanisms ensures system reliability even under node failures. Real-time latency tracking provides insights into component performance. The approach can be extended for large-scale deployment in smart hospitals.

# 9\. Future Scope

\- Integrate real-time disease classification using AI/ML at the Cloudlet layer.  
\- Enable dynamic container orchestration using Kubernetes.  
\- Use Prometheus and Grafana for live system monitoring.  
\- Extend to hybrid-cloud deployment (e.g., GCP + local servers).  
\- Implement patient identity encryption and role-based data access control.
